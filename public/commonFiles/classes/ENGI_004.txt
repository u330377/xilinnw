Technology is everywhere around us whether we like it or not. Let's face it, in order for our children to thrive in this fast changing world, they need to learn certain soft skills as they grow older. Skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, communication, and innovation.
STEAM stands for science, engineering, technology, art, and mathematics. STEAM focused programs can help children in today's world to develop the fundamental knowledge and to learn the skills that can help them become leaders in their future.

Our goal is to use multiple technology curriculum to simplify complex mathematics and scientific concepts in a fun and hands-on environment to encourage students to explore and to build a strong foundation in science and technology.

We are proposing two programs that gear for two different age groups. The first class, engineering and technology for early age, introduces basic sciences and technologies to children. We will also introduce some basic design software, let the children freely express their creativity.
The second class, computer technology for children, is going to explore technologies related to computer. From building a computer game, to create a computer controller for these games. We will also introduce computer aided design (CAD) to encourage their creativity.
