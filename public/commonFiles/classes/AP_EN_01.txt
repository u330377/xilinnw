AP ENGLISH: A Language Arts Course for High School Students 

DEAR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT (especially 9th and 10th Grades):
You will probably take every AP course you possibly can, including AP English. But just because English is what we speak every day does not mean “AP ENGLISH” will be easy. Why? Because it digs deep into the techniques by which writers, poets, and essayists connect with us. It is like the difference between enjoying listening to music and being able to actually understand complicated chord progressions and changes in tempo and key—and write about them accurately and in detail.
Paul Foxworth, who has taught here for eight years, will plunge students deep into the mechanics of written language—to help them speak and write more knowledgeably in their AP course.
REQUIRED TEXT: Cracking the AP English Literature & Composition Exam, 2018 Edition (The Princeton Review).
