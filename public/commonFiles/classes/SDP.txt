Advanced Speech and Debate Program
 
When prestigious universities are admitting students, what criterion do they go by? It has been repeatedly shown that a perfect SAT score is far from enough. Exceptional communication and leadership skills are -- and always will be -- an important asset for prestigious university admissions. Communication is one of the most important skills in a person's life. Lecture training can change the mode of thinking, enhance EQ, build self-confidence, and improve personal charisma. If your child is introverted, you’ll want them to try to express, and increase their self-confidence. If your child is cheerful, you’ll want them to show their nature.
 
Starting from Middle School, we provide systematic training on debating skills so that they not only master the skills of researching, cross-fire, rebuttal, but also learn how to create summary speeches and deliver them. For advanced competition classes, we are taking our students to various national tournaments. In the past year, several of our students advanced from the preliminary rounds with records of 5 wins and 1 loss into the octofinal round for the top sixteen teams in public forum debate at Georgetown University in Washington. Two of our high school students got 2nd places of their chambers at the Illinois Congressional Debate Association tournaments.
